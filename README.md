# OwnRTOS

## Project Description
A simple realtime operating system for ARM M4 architecture

## Inspiration

A RTOS course on udemy only supports keil uvision on windows. Not even using a code base too.
A cross platfrom code is required for this project. 

Share with others and make it opensource.

#Requirements

* eclipse
* eclipse GNU MCU
* ARM ebedded complier tool set
* CMSIS
* Scons (build system) from python package
* MCU board ( STM32F4DISCO)

### Optional

* STM32CUBEMX

## Source

## Advantages

* no loyalty! totally free for your embedded system.
* Very light
* Customisable

## Limitation

* No supporting for Percepio Tracer or system view from Jagger yet
* No queue yet -> Atomic Circular buffer will come in.
* Only C and GNU Assembly code, C++ will come in the scope too.
